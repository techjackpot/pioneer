			<p>When I purchased Pioneer in late 2000, it would have been hard to predict the changes our Industry would go through.  Mergers, rollups, consolidation and acquisitions in a seemingly never ending stream.  More companies importing products, less domestic manufacturing jobs and a subtle assault on the creativity and ingenuity that put America on the Industrial map.</p>
<p>So, how does an Independent, Union Made, US Manufacturer keep pace in such a climate? Technology, equipment and just about anything that looks like it will help our day to day operations in very big ways. It wasn't all that long ago that the fax machine was the preferred method of speed communication. Now, we look back and wonder how we survived without e-mail and cell phones. Even some of our most seasoned veterans (myself included), have had to adapt to these incredible technological changes. I am pleased to say that here at Pioneer, we have chosen to embrace them.<span class="showme">...</span></p>

<div class="hideme">
<p>And yet, we continue to lament the impersonal side of these changes, whether ordering online, or dialing up a call center half way around the world.  When I decided to take Pioneer into the next century, I wanted the best that new technology and equipment could offer, but without losing the very close, personal involvement of our team. This is not merely confined to our employees, but everyone we interact with every day, including our most notable teammate, the customer. It is important to me that every change we make is done so with our partners' interests at heart.  I think I can say with certainty:  We continue to beat the odds and find ways to be a company that’s progressive, but not at the expense of our core values and how we operate. It has taken some time, but more than anything, it has taken hard work and passion to complete this transformation. </p>
<p>The bad news is we are not done; The good news, is that we will never be done. Pioneer’s commitment to be the best will always continue, and for that I thank all of you. Your loyalty, your help and your feedback, has given me the confidence to take these risky but ultimately satisfying steps. Many of you remember where Pioneer was only a short time ago. We have grown from a mostly regional manufacturer to one that ships product worldwide. That growth stems from who we are and what we do daily. We continue to grow in so many ways with one goal that will never change; We will always be here for you!</p>
<p class="signoff">Most Sincerely,<br><br>
Mitchell Dorf<br>
President</p>
